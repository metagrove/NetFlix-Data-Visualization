# NetFlix-Data-Visualization
NetFlix movie and Tv series data

The provided notebook offers a thorough exploration of Netflix movies and TV shows through data visualization, aimed at beginners. It begins with importing essential libraries: numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, and seaborn for advanced visualizations.

The dataset, `netflix1.csv`, is loaded into a pandas DataFrame containing 8790 records and 10 attributes, possibly including title, genre, release year, and rating. The notebook explores the dataset's structure, displaying the number of records and attributes, and providing an overview of the first few rows.

Data cleaning is a crucial step before visualization. This might involve handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering irrelevant data to ensure accurate analysis.

Various visualizations are created to understand the data better. Bar charts compare different categories, such as the number of movies and TV shows across different genres. Histograms display the distribution of numerical data, like the number of releases each year. Scatter plots reveal relationships between two numerical variables, such as release year and rating. Box plots show the distribution of data based on quartiles, highlighting the spread and outliers in ratings.

For example, a bar plot of genre popularity might be created to visualize the number of movies and TV shows in each genre, with rotated labels for better readability. This helps in understanding which genres are most prevalent on Netflix.

Overall, the notebook provides a detailed exploration of the Netflix dataset, using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualizations. Through various plots, it uncovers insights into the distribution, trends, and relationships within the data, making it easier for beginners to understand and analyze Netflix's content. This project serves as an excellent introduction to data visualization techniques and their application in real-world datasets.
